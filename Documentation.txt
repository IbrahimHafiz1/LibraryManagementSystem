## 📌 **Overview**  
The **Library Management System** is a desktop application built using **C# and Windows Forms** to help manage books efficiently.

## 🔥 **Features**  
### 🏛 **Book Management**
- Add books with **Title, Author, and ISBN**.  
- If a book with the **same title and author** exists, it **increases the quantity** instead of adding a new row.  
- If the **same title but a different author** is added, it is shown **as a separate entry**.  

### 🔍 **Search Functionality**
- Search books **by title**.  
- Results **show available and borrowed copies** for clarity.  

### 📚 **Borrow & Return Books**
- Click on a book **row** to select it.  
- Click **Borrow** to borrow a book (if available).  
- Click **Return** to return a book (if it was borrowed by the user).  
- **Borrowing works per book and author**, ensuring accurate tracking.  

### 📊 **Dynamic Book Display**
- Books are grouped by **Title and Author** for clarity.  
- **Total Copies, Available Copies, and Borrowed Copies** are displayed.  
- **Borrowed books show who borrowed them**.
